# Wumpus-World-Logical
It's a logical reasoning task that allow a guy to reach the gold while avoiding to fall in the pit or be eaten by a Wumpus monster. The major points here are the knowledge of the agents, and the sensing that it can have from different dangers. The whole file is not inserted because it came from my last professor, I just added my own file here if someone is interested. The program is written in prolog.
Here a really good explanation of the problem :  https://www.javatpoint.com/the-wumpus-world-in-artificial-intelligence
